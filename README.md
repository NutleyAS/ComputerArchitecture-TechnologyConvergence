# Computer Architecture And Technology Convergence

## Introduction

This repository contains the project that I submitted for the Computer Architecture & Technology Convergence module as part of the Higher Diploma in Software Development at GMIT. 

## The Project

The project was broken down into two parts. 

### Part 1

Part 1 consisted of 5 questions which are answered in the pdf file titled "2020NutleyCATCProject".

### Part 2

For Part 2 of the project was a Linux assignment that I had to answer questions for.

**Question 1** 

Was to enter specified commands into a Linux terminal. This was on a AWS VM which was created during the course of the module as part of given homework. The answers for this part are clearly defined in the pdf file.

**Question 2**

Was to create a shell script called "aronNutley.sh" using the Vim text editor that contained a spefied set of commands. Once it had been verfied that the script works, add output redirection to append the output of each command to a file called "aronNutley.txt". These files are included in this repository and the work is clearly shown in the pdf file. 

**Question 3**

Was to change the access permissions and the answer is shown in the pdf file.

**Question 4**

Was to create a shell script that behaves like an Irish person offering a cup of tea. This is shown in the pdf file and the script file “aronNutleyTea2.sh”.
